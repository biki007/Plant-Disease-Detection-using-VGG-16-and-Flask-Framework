# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-VGG-16-and-Flask-Framework
Transforming agriculture, our project deploys AI and a VGG-16 model to detect
plant diseases with 88.67% accuracy. Analyzing 4,000 leaf images, it enables swift
disease identification for informed farmer action. Using Flask, our automatic
system streamlines disease detection, reducing manual farm monitoring efforts
